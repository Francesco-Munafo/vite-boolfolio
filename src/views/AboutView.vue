          If you are here it means that you want to know more about me. Ok then
          take a sit and listen 😁. I was born in 1997 in Milazzo, a city in
          Messina, Italy.
        </p>
        <p class="cm_font pf_text_main fs-5">
          Since kid I was attracted by all sort of technologies, especially by
          videogames. I got a degree in a
          <strong>"Mechanics, Mechatronics and Energy"</strong>
          so I learned some Engineering bases.
        </p>
        <p class="cm_font pf_text_light fs-5">
          I worked for <strong>Italian Navy</strong> for 4 years where I made a
          lot of experience working alone or in team.
        </p>
        <p class="cm_font pf_text_main fs-5">
          Later I figured out that my passion for technology was too strong and
          I decided to do a <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong> course
          provided by
          <a href="https://boolean.careers/" target="_blank">Boolean</a> and
          became a <strong>Coding Padawan</strong>!
        </p>
        <p class="cm_font pf_text_light fs-5">
          I learned
          <strong>HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, mySQL, Vue.js and Laravel</strong> but I
          expect to learn more and more languages!
