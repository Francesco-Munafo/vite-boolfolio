          If you are here it means that you want to know more about me. Ok then
          take a sit and listen üòÅ. I was born in 1997 in Milazzo, a city in
          Messina, Italy. Since kid I was attracted by all sort of technologies,
          especially by videogames. I got a degree in a "Mechanics, Mechatronics
          and Energy" so I learned some Engineering bases. I worked for Italian
          Navy for 4 years where I made a lot of experience working alone or in
          team. Later I figured out that my passion for technology was too
          strong and I decided to do a Full Stack Web Developer course provided
          by Boolean. I learned HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, mySQL, Vue.js and Laravel
          but I expect to learn more and more languages!
